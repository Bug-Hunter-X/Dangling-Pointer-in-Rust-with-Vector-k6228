This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: using a dangling pointer after a vector goes out of scope. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version that avoids the dangling pointer issue. The core problem is that the raw pointer `ptr` continues to point to memory which is no longer owned by a valid Rust object. This is a classic example of a memory safety violation that can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or data corruption.
